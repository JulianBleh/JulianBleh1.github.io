Profile
======
My research concerns our ability to imagine social change and how envisioning an alternative to the status quo relates to collective action. More specifically, what enables us to imagine a more sustainable, just, democratic and solidaric society? Under which conditions do societal visions, like utopias, motivate us to act upon socio-ecological change, and what role do social identity processes play in this? Further, I'm interested in the social psychological effects of social movements, and I evaluate projects and facilitate processes dealing with socio-ecological change, political participation, transformative education, as well as climate communications.
